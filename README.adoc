= Spring Cloud Sleuth Issues

This repository contains issues related to Spring Cloud Sleuth.
Sometimes an issue is impossible to be replicated in the build of Spring Cloud Sleuth, due to classpath issues.

In order for us not to have regressions, we will put those more complex issues in this repository and run automated tests.

IMPORTANT: You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed to run these tests

== Running tests

Just execute

```bash
$ ./scripts/runAcceptanceTests.sh
```

That way we'll

* setup infrastructure (Kafka etc.)
* run integration tests of each application
